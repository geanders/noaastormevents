* This is a new release.
* This package suggests a package in a non-mainstream repository (a drat repository). On the Windows build, this results in the NOTE "Package suggested but not available for checking".
* The Windows build lists some possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION. We have confirmed that these words are spelled correctly. 

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
