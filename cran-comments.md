* The previous version of this package was archived on CRAN because it requires a package
that was archived by CRAN. That package dependency (hurricaneexposure) has now been updated and
is again available on CRAN. This package has been updated to require the latest version of that
dependency package. 
* This package suggests a package in a non-mainstream repository (a drat repository). On the Windows build, this results in the NOTE "Package suggested but not available for checking".
* The Windows build lists some possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION. We have confirmed that these words are spelled correctly.
