<p>This vignette provides more details on how the
<code>noaastormevents</code> package interacts with the online NOAA
Storm Events database to pull storm event listings based on user
queries.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="structure-of-noaa-storm-events-data">Structure of NOAA Storm Events data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#structure-of-noaa-storm-events-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>The NOAA Storm Events data is available online at <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/" class="external-link uri">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/</a>. That website
includes documentation on the data, as well as a page that allows bulk
data download of yearly csv files either through ftp or http (<a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp" class="external-link uri">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp</a>). Data is
available from January 1950 and tends to be updated to within a few
months of present.</p>
<p>Data is stored in bulk by year in compressed comma-separated files
(<code>.csv.gz</code> files). Each year has three compressed files
available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>StormEvents_details</code> file</li>
<li>
<code>StormEvents_fatalities</code> file</li>
<li>
<code>StormEvents_loations</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p>File names for each file include both the year of the data (e.g.,
“1950”) and the date the file was last modified (e.g., “20170120”).
Files are given regular names other than these two specifications. This
regular naming scheme allows us to use regular expressions in code
within the <code>noaastormevents</code> package on all listed file names
to identify the exact name of a file for a specific year, as explained
in the next section.</p>
<p>The size of all three file types has increased with time (see figure
below; note that the y-axis is log 10). The largest file for any given
year is the “Details” file. Most file sizes increased substantially in
1996 (dotted vertical line), when the database dramatically expanded the
types of events it included. Before 1996, the database covered tornadoes
and, for some years, a few other types of events. From 1996, the
database expanded to include events like floods, tropical storms, snow
storms, etc. While “Locations” files exist in the database for early
years, they contain no information until 1996. See the documentation at
the NOAA Storm Events database website for more information on the
coverage of the database at different times across its history.</p>
<p><img src="a03_details_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="downloading-noaa-storm-events-data-for-a-year">Downloading NOAA Storm Events data for a year<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#downloading-noaa-storm-events-data-for-a-year"></a>
</h2>
<p>The database data is stored in files separated by year, so the file
for an entire year is identified and downloaded when a user asks for
event listings from any time or any type of event that year. For
example, if a user wants to list flood events from the week of Hurricane
Floyd in 1999, functions in the <code>noaastormevents</code> package
would first identify and download the full “Details” data file for 1999
and then filter down to flood events starting in the correct week.</p>
<p>To identify the online file path for a specific year, the
<code>find_file_name</code> function in the <code>noaastormevents</code>
package uses the <code>htmltab</code> function (from the package of the
same name) to create a dataframe listing all files available for
download from the NOAA Storm Events database. The function then uses
regular expressions to identify the file name in that listing for the
requested year. For example, the name of the file with “Details”
information for 1999 can be determined with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/find_file_name.html">find_file_name</a></span><span class="op">(</span>year <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"1999"</span>, file_type <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"detail"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">## [1] "StormEvents_details-ftp_v1.0_d1999_c20220425.csv.gz"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here is the full definition of the <code>find_file_name</code>
function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Typically, this function will only be used internally rather than
called directly by a user.</p>
<p>Once the file name has been determined, a function in the package
then downloads that file to the user’s computer. For some years, files
are very large, so this download can take a little while. To avoid
downloading data from the same year more than once within an R session,
the downloading function stores the downloaded data for that year in a
temporary environment in the R user’s session. In later requests for the
same year, the function will first check for data from this year in the
temporary environment and only download the data from the online
database if it is not already available on the user’s computer.</p>
<p>This environment is created to be temporary, which means that it is
deleted at the end of the current R session. While some packages that
access online databases cache any downloaded data in a way that persists
between R sessions, we chose not to do that and instead only cache
within an R session, but delete all data at the close of the R session.
This is because some of the Storm Event files are very large, and most
users will likely only want to keep a small subset of the data for a
given year (e.g., only flood events during the week of Hurricane Floyd).
It would be wasteful of memory to cache all the 1999 data indefinitely
on the user’s computer in this case; instead, the user should use our
package to create the desired subset of the data and then explicitly
store that subset locally to use in future analysis.</p>
<p>The function for downloading the file for a year is called
<code>download_storm_data</code>. Here is it’s full definition:</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>noaastormevents</code> package allows a user to
query storm events either by a date range or by a named historical
tropical storm, rather than a year. The <code>create_storm_data</code>
function inputs either a date range or a storm name, as well as the
requested file type, and downloads data for the appropriate year or
years. If the user requests a date range, the function will download
yearly data files for all years included in that range. If the user
requests a tropical storm, the function will pull the data for that
particular year. Here is the full definition of
<code>create_storm_data</code>:</p>

<p>As a note, many of the functions in the <code>noaastormevents</code>
package that allow linking events with tropical storms rely on
historical data for the storms, including storm tracks, estimated
distances to eastern U.S. counties, and dates when the storm was closest
to each county. The package pulls this historical data from the
<code>hurricaneexposuredata</code> package, through the interfacing
package <code>hurricaneexposure</code>. The hurricane data goes from
1988 to (currently) 2015 and includes all Atlantic basin tropical storms
that came within 250 km of at least one U.S. county. The following
storms are included in that package and so available to be used for
functions in <code>noaastormevents</code>:</p>

<p>Here are how the start dates for listings for each event type are
distributed over the year (event types are ordered by decreasing total
count during the year; note that the y-axes vary depending on the range
of events by date for each event type):</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="co">## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'date'. You can override using the</span></span>
<span><span class="co">## `.groups` argument.</span></span></code></pre>
<p><img src="a03_details_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Many event types are clearly seasonal (e.g., winter weather, winter
storms, heavy snow, cold, extreme cold, blizzards, ice storms,
lake-effect snow, and avalanches are all much more common during winter
months, while tropical depressions and tropical storms are all limited
to the hurricane season). However, for some events, reporting seasonal
patterns might be based not just on the true pattern of events but also
on the timing of important exposures and impacts of the events. For
example, rip currents have many more listings during the spring and
summer, which may be related to events being more likely to be listed
when more people are swimming. Frost event listings are particularly
high at the start and end of the frost season, rather than in the middle
of winter, which may be related to the impacts of frost on crops being
higher in spring and fall than during the winter. If working with this
data, it important to keep in mind that the data are based on reporting,
and there may be related influences on the probability of an event being
reported and included in the data that differ from using data from
something like a weather station.</p>

</h3>
<p>“Episodes” seem to collect related “events”, where events can vary in
the type or location of the event, while an “episode” collects events
that belong to the same large system. The following graph shows, for
each episode listed in 2015, the number of events listed for the episode
(x-axis) and the size (in days) of the range of begin dates across
events in the episode.</p>
<p><img src="a03_details_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>An episode will never include events in more than one state, so a
large weather system could potentially be described by multiple episodes
in different states:</p>

<p>Here are maps with the beginning locations of events in the episodes
with the most events in 2015. Note that the beginning latitude and
longitude are not listed for every event, resulting in one of the
episodes not having any points on the map. From the other maps, it is
clear that events within the episode were fairly close together.</p>
<p><img src="a03_details_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>For these episodes with the most events in 2015, the following graph
shows the number of events reported for the episode. One of the episodes
was a winter storm, another was heavy rains and floods, while the rest
of the episodes included high winds, hail, tornadoes, rain, and / or
flooding.</p>
<p><img src="a03_details_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>Once we removed event types with less that 50 listings in 2015, we
did a cluster analysis of event types, to group events that are more
likely to occur together within an episode. The following plot shows the
resulting cluster structure of these event types.</p>

<p>The next graph shows the number of events of each event type

<p>The majority of events in this database, at least for 2015, were
reported by either a trained spotter or the public.</p>
<p>The following graph shows, for each type of event in 2015, the
percent reported by each source. For some types of events, reporting is
dominated by a specific source. For example, most high surf reports come
from trained spotters, while most drought reports come from drought
monitors and most tornado reports come from the NWS Storm Survey. For
other types of events, reporting sources are more diversified. Both axes
of the plot are ordered by overall frequency (i.e., overall number of
each type of event and overall number of reports from each source).</p>

<p>Some events are reported by forecast zone (<code>CZTYPE</code> of
“Z”) rather than county (<code>CZTYPE</code> of “C”). Specific types of
events are typically either always reported for a county or always
reported for a forecast zone (see table below). Events typically
reported by county include floods (“Flash Flood”, “Flood”, “Debris
Flow”), tornado-like events (“Tornado”, “Funnel Cloud”, “Dust Devil”),
and a few other events often related to thunderstorms (“Thunderstorm
Wind”, “Hail”, “Heavy Rain”, “Lightning”). Events typically reported by
forecast zone include severe winter weather (“Winter Weather”, “Winter
Storm”, “Heavy Snow”, “Cold/Wind Chill”, “Extreme Cold/Wind Chill”,
“Blizzard”, “Frost/Freeze”, “Ice Storm”, “Sleet”, “Lake-Effect Snow”,
“Avalanche”, “Freezing Fog”), extreme heat (“Heat”, “Excessive Heat”,
“Drought”), events related to the water or coast (“Marine Thunderstorm
Wind”, “High Surf”, “Coastal Flood”, “Waterspout”, “Astronomical Low
Tide”, “Rip Current”, “Tropical Storm”, “Marine High Wind”, “Marine
Hail”, “Marine Strong Wind”, “Hurricane”, “Seiche”, “Storm Surge/Tide”,
“Tropical Depression”, “Marine Dense Fog”, “Sneakerwave”, “Tsunami”),
and a few others (“High Wind”, “Dense Fog”, “Strong Wind”, “Wildfire”,
“Dust Storm”, “Dense Smoke”).</p>

<p>Within the code in <code>noaastormevents</code>, the
<code>match_forecast_county</code> is used to try to match a county FIPS
to each of the events listed by forecast zone. To get the full code for
that function, you can run <code>match_forecast_county</code> (i.e., the
function name, without parentheses after). To match an events listed by
forecast zone to a county, this function tries the following to try to
match all or part of the <code>state_name</code> and
<code>cz_name</code> columns in the storm events data to the state and
county names in the <code>county.fips</code> dataframe that comes with
the <code>maps</code> package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tries to match <code>cz_name</code> to the county name in
<code>county.fips</code> after removing any periods or apostrophes in
<code>cz_name</code>.</li>
<li>Next, for county names with ‘county’ in them, try to match the word
before ‘county’ to county name in <code>county.fips</code>. Then check
the two words before ‘county’, then the one and two words before
‘counties’.</li>
<li>Next, pull out the last word in <code>cz_name</code> and try to
match it to the county name in <code>county.fips</code>. Then check the
last two words in <code>cz_name</code>, then check the last three words
in <code>cz_name</code>.</li>
<li>Next, pull any words right before a slash and check that against the
county name.</li>
<li>Finally, try removing anything in parentheses in
<code>cz_name</code> before matching.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, there are a few final steps in cleaning the data. First,
all listings with “Utah” in the <code>cz_name</code> are set to missing–
while there is a Utah County, Utah, from inspection of event listings in
2015, events in Utah with “Utah” in <code>cz_name</code> often referred
to parts of the state, rather than to the county. Further, any event
with “National Park” listed in <code>cz_name</code> is set to not match
with a county FIPS. In Wyoming, Park County was being matched to a
<code>cz_name</code> for Yellowstone National Park, and this could be a
problem in other states, so this extra check was included.</p>

<p>When using this function, and for event listings generated using this
function, the user may want to hand-check that event listings with names
like “Lake” and “Mountain” in the <code>cz_name</code> column are not
erroneously matched to counties with names like “Lake County” and
“Mountain County”. Code like the following can be used for these checks
(in this case, checking a dataframe of event listings named
<code>z_events_2015</code> that is output from
<code>match_forecast_county</code> and so has <code>fips</code> added
for each event listing, if a match could be found):</p>

<p>Therefore, the <code>noaastormevents</code> package uses a function
to pull out these abbreviations and convert associated impact values to
numeric values (e.g., 5000 for “5.00K”). The conversions conducted
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“K” = 1,000</li>
<li>“M” = 1,000,000</li>

<p>Usually, it seems that the cost per events within an episode do not
overlap, so that the costs from all events in an episode can be summed
to generate a total damage cost. While in some cases, different event
listings within the same county in the same episode have the same damage
cost, it often seems that the total cost was divided in these cases
across events, as in this case, where the total estimated cost of
$6,186,909 in the county (see the narratives) was spread evenly over the
two event listings:</p>

<td align="center">A historic flooding event affected the Carolinas from
October 1-7, 2015. A stalled front offshore combined with deep tropical
moisture streaming northwest into the area ahead of a strong upper level
low pressure system to the west and Hurricane Joaquin well to the east.
This led to historic 4-day rainfall totals with widespread amounts of
15-20 inches and localized amounts over 25 inches, mainly in the
Charleston Tri-County area. Flash flooding was prevalent for several
days and eventually led to Flash Flood Emergencies for Charleston,
Berkeley, Dorchester and Colleton counties during the morning hours of
October 4, 2015. Many people had to be rescued by emergency personnel
while significant damage occurred to numerous properties and roads.
Tides were also historically high due to the recent perigean spring tide
and persistent onshore winds, exacerbating and prolonging flooding
across the area and along the coast, especially in downtown Charleston.
||The most significant flooding occurred in areas along and near smaller
creeks and streams, especially those that were tributaries to larger
rivers such as the Edisto, Ashley, Cooper, and Santee. In addition to
impacting thousands of homes and businesses, flood waters also damaged
many roads and bridges in the area, causing significant travel
disruptions that lasted for multiple days. Furthermore, some roads and
bridges were so badly damaged that it will likely take weeks to months
to repair.||As of 12/31/15, a SCEMD report indicated an estimated total
monetary damage of $4,533,337 in Berkeley County, $18,213,860 in
Charleston County, $2,030,879 in Colleton County and $6,186,909 in
Dorchester County for the flood event. Total costs for each county have
been divided equally to each flash flood report within that particular
county for this flood event and are considered estimates only.</td>

This led to historic 4-day rainfall totals with widespread amounts of
15-20 inches and localized amounts over 25 inches, mainly in the
Charleston Tri-County area. Flash flooding was prevalent for several
days and eventually led to Flash Flood Emergencies for Charleston,
Berkeley, Dorchester and Colleton counties during the morning hours of
October 4, 2015. Many people had to be rescued by emergency personnel
while significant damage occurred to numerous properties and roads.
Tides were also historically high due to the recent perigean spring tide
and persistent onshore winds, exacerbating and prolonging flooding
across the area and along the coast, especially in downtown Charleston.
||The most significant flooding occurred in areas along and near smaller
creeks and streams, especially those that were tributaries to larger
rivers such as the Edisto, Ashley, Cooper, and Santee. In addition to
impacting thousands of homes and businesses, flood waters also damaged
many roads and bridges in the area, causing significant travel
disruptions that lasted for multiple days. Furthermore, some roads and
bridges were so badly damaged that it will likely take weeks to months
to repair.||As of 12/31/15, a SCEMD report indicated an estimated total
monetary damage of $4,533,337 in Berkeley County, $18,213,860 in
Charleston County, $2,030,879 in Colleton County and $6,186,909 in
Dorchester County for the flood event. Total costs for each county have
been divided equally to each flash flood report within that particular
county for this flood event and are considered estimates only.</td>

<p>However, there are a few cases where it appears that costs might be
duplicated over different events within the same episode in a county.
For example, in the following listing, it looks like the total estimated
damage cost of $1.7 million (see that narrative) is repeated over the
two listed events, which would mean that adding damages across events in
the episode would lead to a county damage cost of twice the true
amount.</p>

identical across the event listings for the county and episode, while in
452 cases (13%) the cost listings were identical across event listings

<td align="left">Heavy rain led to flash flooding across portions of
North Central Texas on the 23rd and 24th, with residual flooding lasting
through at least the 25th. Rainfall totals in flood damaged areas ranged
from 5 to 21+ inches within a 36 hour period. The highest rainfall
totals were in Navarro County which suffered significant damage across
the entire county. Flood waters derailed a train north of Corsicana and
many county and farm-to-market roads were washed away. The flooding in
Navarro County persisted for weeks in areas where the water had a very
difficult time draining. Rainfall totals near 20 inches also fell in
southern Hill County were many roads were covered with water.</td>

<td align="left">Shortly before 0800 CST, elevated thunderstorms
intensified across the western South Plains and far eastern New Mexico
in response to a surge of Gulf moisture ahead of a mid-level trough.
Unlike the previous day when widespread morning storms contaminated the
potential for severe storms later in the day, this day featured multiple
rounds of severe storms from mid-morning through late afternoon rumbling
over the South Plains, Rolling Plains and the far southeast Texas
Panhandle. The majority of these thunderstorms were elevated with large
hail and failed to become surface based thanks to a large outflow
boundary that surged south from early morning storms. Despite favorable
low level wind shear for tornadoes, the fast-moving outflow boundary was
a saving grace of sorts in that it quickly undercut supercells and
prevented them from becoming tornadic. Nonetheless, the severe storms
that did develop proved costly to many residents across the region,
especially in and around the cities of Plainview and Slaton where
extensive damage to homes, businesses, vehicles, and wheat crops was
reported.</td>

<td align="left">A potent upper level storm system developed over
Arizona on Christmas Day then moved slowly east along the Mexico border
through the 27th. Snow developed quickly from south to north over New
Mexico on the 26th while an arctic cold front raced south and west
across the state. Wind gusts behind the front averaged 60 to 80 mph
across the eastern plains. The combination of heavy snow and high winds
created blizzard conditions across nearly the entire eastern half of New
Mexico. Travel across all of eastern New Mexico was shut down. The
entire stretch of Interstate 40 from Albuquerque to Amarillo was shut
down for nearly 36 hours. A Civil Emergency was declared for Quay,
Curry, Roosevelt, De Baca, Chaves, and eastern Lincoln counties as
dozens of motorists were stranded in their vehicles in 6 to 10 foot snow
drifts. Department of Public Safety assisted a total of 455 motorists.
Emergency response personnel were even stranded trying to reach these
motorists. Residents were blockaded in their homes with drifts up to the
top of roofs. Xcel Energy reported power outages in at least 14,200
residences across eastern New Mexico and at least 30,000 residential
disruptions during the storm. Numerous trees and power lines were downed
as well as several structures due to the weight of heavy snow. Snowfall
accumulations of 15 to 30 inches were common from the central mountain
chain eastward across much of the plains. Ski Apache reported a whopping
41 inches. Department of Agriculture reported around 12,000 adult
milking cows perished in the storm and between 30,000 and 50,000 young
livestock died. A couple 1-day snowfall records were broken with this
event. One person died from exposure in Albuquerque and another while
shoveling snow in Roswell. The New Mexico EOC coordinated with the
National Guard to assist several counties with disaster operations.</td>

<td align="left">A deep fetch of Gulf moisture overspread the South
Plains this afternoon in advance of a slow-moving trough. Numerous
thunderstorms erupted by late afternoon across the western South Plains
and spread slowly northeast through the overnight hours under weak upper
level winds. The slow nature of these storms resulted in torrential
rainfall rates and flooding in many areas, but the most impressive
rainfall and flooding bulls-eyed in central and southern Lynn County
where between 6 and 12 inches of rain was measured before midnight.
Nearly all roads in Lynn County were closed by DPS officials due to
standing water in excess of one foot over long stretches. The city of
Tahoka became marooned by floodwaters forcing emergency officials to
give stranded motorists refuge in area shelters. When these shelters
either reached capacity or were threatened by floodwaters, officials
transported persons to adjacent counties for safety. To add insult to
injury, additional rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain developed
early in the morning on the 5th and prolonged flooding issues over much
of the southern South Plains and southern Rolling Plains. Schools in
Tahoka were closed on the 5th due to many roads remaining impassable.
Dozens of vehicles from Lubbock to Tahoka required rescuing after
motorists drove into deep floodwaters and became stranded. Most of these
flooded cars were deemed complete losses after the engines became
hydrolocked. One small child suffered a head injury after the car they
were in hydroplaned abruptly near Southland (Garza County). Combined
damage to vehicles, homes and thousands of acres of wheat crops
(particularly in Lynn County) could exceed $300M.</td>

<td align="left">A prolonged period of rainfall occurred from the early
morning hours of December 26th to the evening of December 28th. The
heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest
Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into
central Illinois. Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged
from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and
southeast to the state border. Some of the precipitation fell as a
wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of
the state. All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many
rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the
Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley
Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade
and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points
downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the
Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia
River at Vandalia. The only location not reporting flooding after this
event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam
regulates the flow. All other forecast points reported at least minor
flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the
heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or
destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar
amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.</td>

<td align="left">An upper level shortwave trough moved around the
longwave low over the Four Corners region. This upper distubance
interacted with a surface boundary moving northward as a warm front from
South Texas into a very moist airmass. This combination led to
thunderstorms that produced heavy rain and isolated severe weather. A
historic flash flood occurred on the Blanco River late Saturday night
into Sunday. Hundreds of homes were destroyed along the river from the
City of Blanco down into Wimberley and San Marcos. The flood wave
continued downstream for days affecting residents and homes along the
San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers. Early estimates show damages in excess
of 100 million dollars. Several people lost their lives due to flash
flooding. A large tornado outbreak occurred this Saturday night

<td align="left">An historic winter storm struck Middle Tennessee just 2
days after a widespread snowfall and only 4 days after another major
winter storm affected the area. Light snow moved into the area during
the afternoon hours on February 20. Although temperatures remained near
or below freezing, the snow transitioned to sleet and eventually
freezing rain across Middle Tennessee through the night as temperatures
warmed aloft due to a very powerful 850 mb jet. This low level jet was
measured at 86 knots on the 12Z February 21 OHX upper air sounding, the
highest known measurement of an 850 mb wind speed at NWS Nashville.
Continued strong warm air advection gradually warmed surface
temperatures above freezing from southwest to northeast across Middle
Tennessee during the morning hours on February 21. ||Due to significant
ice remaining on trees and power lines from the previous winter storms
earlier in the week, along with gusty south winds from 30 to 50 mph,
widespread ice storm damage occurred across eastern Middle Tennessee.
The worst damage was on the Cumberland Plateau, where ice accumulations
reached up to 1. This icing brought down thousands of trees, power
lines, and power poles, blocking numerous roadways and damaging many
homes, businesses, and other structures. Many residents of Fentress,
eastern Overton, Cumberland, eastern Putnam, eastern White and Van Buren
counties were without power for 2 weeks, and some were without power for
up to 1 month. Local utilities companies and emergency management
described the ice storm damage as one of the worst natural disasters to
ever affect the region, comparable to an EF2 tornado striking the entire
area. A Presidential disaster declaration was made for the Cumberland
Plateau in April 2015.</td>
