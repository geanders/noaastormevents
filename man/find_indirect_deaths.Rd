\usage{
find_indirect_deaths(date_range = NULL, event_type = NULL,
  dist_limit = NULL, storm = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{date_range}{A character vector of length two with the start and end
dates to pull data for (e.g., \code{c("1999-10-16", "1999-10-18")}).}

\item{event_type}{Specifies the types of storm events should be included.}

\item{dist_limit}{If selected, the distance (in kilometers) that a county
must be from the storm's path to be included.}

\item{storm}{A character string with the name of the storm to pull storm
events data for. This string must follow the format
"[storm-name]-[4-digit storm year]" (e.g., \code{"Floyd-1999"}).
Currently, this functionality only works for storms included in the
extended hurricane best tracks, which covers 1988 to 2015.}
